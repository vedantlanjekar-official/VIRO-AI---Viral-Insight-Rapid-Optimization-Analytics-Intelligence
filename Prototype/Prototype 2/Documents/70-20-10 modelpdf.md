Below is the structured data sourcing and acquisition strategy,
meticulously detailing the size allocation (in GB) for each data pillar
and how that data will be distributed across the mandatory **70/20/10**
**Train-Validation-Test** **(T-V-T)** **model**.

**Viro-AI** **Data** **Architecture:** **40GB** **T-V-T** **Allocation**

The total 40GB dataset is strategically partitioned, with the largest
portion dedicated to training the AI/ML models and the smallest reserved
for the final, unbiased performance review.

||
||
||
||
||
||

**Pillar** **1:** **Genomic** **Data** **(Sequences** **and**
**Mutations)**

Genomic data forms the largest data pillar, as the **Predictive**
**Engine** requires vast sequence libraries to accurately predict
mutation patterns (e.g., using LSTM/GRU networks) and assign a
"Deadliness" score.\[1, 1\]

||
||
||
||
||

||
||
||
||

**Pillar** **2:** **Structural** **Data** **(3D** **Protein**
**Structures)**

Structural data is essential for the **Antidote** **Generation**
**Module** and **Simulation** **Module**, enabling molecular docking and
the dynamic 3D visualization of drug interaction.1

||
||
||
||
||

||
||
||
||
||

**Pillar** **3:** **Clinical** **&** **Pharmaceutical** **Data**

Clinical and Pharmaceutical data provides the crucial **ground**
**truth** for training the AI to correlate genomic features with
real-world health outcomes and is the primary input for the "Deadliness"
score.1
